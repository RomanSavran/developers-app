</p>
<p dir="ltr">

	party
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
	suppliers of such data (“Data Supplier(s)”). Further, the Customer may
	create

	building data models or digital twins of real-world objects (“Customer
	Data”).
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
	3.3 Unless expressly agreed otherwise, the Customer manages its Data
	Suppliers which
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
	Data Suppliers are not in a direct contractual relationship with the
	Supplier. Such Data
</p>
<p dir="ltr">

</p>
<p dir="ltr">
	the Service.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
	3.4 When entering into the Agreement, the Customer shall specify all its

</p>
<p dir="ltr">

	shall agree
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
	on the provision of apps or data directly with their customers, subject to
	the
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
	marketplace agreement and subject to both parties of such transaction

<p dir="ltr">
	service plans made available by the Supplier.

</p>
<p dir="ltr">
	effect on the agreed contents of the Service or the agreed service levels,
	the Supplier
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
	shall inform the Customer of such change at least thirty (30) days before
	the effective
</p>
<p dir="ltr">

<p dir="ltr">
	3.8 The Supplier shall always have the right but shall have no obligation
	to make without
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
	prior notification such changes to the Service that (a) concern or relate
	to the

<p dir="ltr">
	production environment of the Service and do not have an adverse effect on
	the agreed
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
	contents of the Service or the agreed service levels, (b) are necessary to

</p>
<p dir="ltr">
	11.2 All facilities used to store and process the Customer Data and

	Customer Data existing solely within the Service (such as created data
	structures or
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
	workflows) may not be returned to the Customer. After the thirty (30) days'
	period, the
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
